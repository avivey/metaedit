metaedit
========

- what, who, how

Usage:
------
- New project is always branched of `master`. Either pick a name before
  starting, or when saving first file.
- So you can actually browse stuff before you start editing.
- You can update `master` with the upstream with a single click.

Build / Develop:
----------------
metaedit runs in a browser. It does need to be served over http(s), but requires
only to be served as static content.
There are some node.js dependencies that needs to be collected, minified and
served. They are:

- js-git
- js-github
- gen-run
- json-stable-stringify

And in order to package them, you'll also need nodejs itself, and
- browserify
- minify

then run build.sh to generate the bundle.
